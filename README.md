This is a game on dice which involves two players.Each player rolls the dice as much as he wishes and the number on the face is added to his/her total.However,if during the rolls you get a "1",when passing the dice to the next person,nothing will be added to your points.If you roll and get any other set of numbers apart from "1",when passing the dice to the next person,all accumulated points will be added to your total.
